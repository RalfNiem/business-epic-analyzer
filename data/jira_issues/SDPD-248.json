Simplification).\n  Clarify open points for exploration with Márta Orsolya Völgyiné Nadabán and Viktor Matus. Need to clarify  also the timeline /deadline when the processes shall be finalized. \n  Consider topic for the simplification: \n Identify and explore impact of the architectural adaption for MIST LAN/WLAN (as worked out and explained in the architectural workshop/Tribe offsite workshops) on the respective process step ‘order of hardware’. Consider dependencies on other measures of the simplification program and align also with technical product management.\n ",
