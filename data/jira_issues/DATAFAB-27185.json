  "description": "Description\n1. Epic Description\nEpic (Requirement and Scope) \nThe epic aims to implement the functionality of aggregating usage data for the Data Best Pool Model within the Self Service Portal. Currently, the Self Service Portal lacks the capability to provide aggregated usage data for the Data Best Pool Model.\nBy introducing this feature, users will have access to consolidated usage data, enabling them to monitor and optimize customer data consumption more efficiently.\nCurrently in the TMSP we have the dynamic pooling model, that presents the sum of all per SIM inclusive volume of the SIMs per month in the pooling tariff. Each SIM contributes a certain predefined volume to the corresponding pool when activated and the pool size grows depending on the number of the active SIMs in this pool tariff automatically. The customer must know which use cases are affected and must calculate the needed volume exactly depending on the number of his active SIMs to implement his business before signing the contract with the corresponding sales MNO (TDG, TMA, ...).\nAfter implementation new attributes and logic for Data Best Pool Model in Self Service Portal, more aggregated data related the usage data is required.\nCurrently, the Self Service Portal does not offer the functionality to aggregate usage data specifically for the Data Best Pool Model.\nCustomers want to have possibility to compare usual non-data Best usages and Data Best Usages and analyze the data usage for all types of tariffs .To have such reporting, new dimensions and aggregations needs to be done especially for data best. It is also required to make adaptations of current M2M Self Service Portal attributes.\n  New Features:\nThe following topics are covered in this EPIC:\nAdd aggregated usage data for Data Best in USAGE Daily and Monthly folders.\nIt should be possible to analyze Data Best Pool Model usages together with all other usages by using existing attributes. \nData consumption values should be correct for Data Best. For SMS/VOICE= Null.\nMVP\nImprove the functionality of the M2M Self Service Portal, enabling users to effortlessly generate detailed reports tailored to their specific requirements.\nStreamline the user interface of the portal to enhance usability and facilitate intuitive navigation for all users.\nImplement optimizations to ensure the portal operates efficiently, providing quick response times even when handling complex queries and large datasets.\nBenefits\n Power users in departments can leverage the portal to access relevant data directly, promoting transparency and enabling them to address queries independently.\n By providing users with the tools to generate their own reports, the need for manual service requests diminishes, freeing up resources and reducing the workload on support teams. This leads to greater efficiency and cost savings for the organization.\nWith enhanced report generation capabilities, users gain greater control over accessing and analyzing data, empowering them to make informed decisions.\n By enabling users to generate sophisticated reports based on their unique needs, the portal facilitates deeper insights into data, driving better-informed decision-making processes\n#benefit\nStable data quality due to error-free loading.\nMore than 150 for TDG customers will benefit from the demand\nMore than 1000 customers expected by marketing of the data best pooling model products\nMore than 10 Mio SIM Cards will be impacted by the demand\n \nAdditional revenue\nRevenue in Cent /SIM /Month 50 ct / SIM / Month\nRevenue over 5 Years 25 Mio â‚¬ \n    Specific Deliverables  \nNone\n  Acceptance Criteria (conditions which must be satisfied for the Epic to be accepted)\nAggregated usage data for Data Best is added in USAGE Daily and Monthly folders.\nIt is be possible to analyze Data Best Pool Model usages together with all other usages by using existing attributes. \nData consumption values is correct for Data Best.\nOut of Scope\nCreation of new reports, system architecture changes. BI Launchpad reports are not affected.\nDependencies \nThe mapping in the source system is clear and accessible, and the changes have been approved by a business side.\n2. Technical / Solution Design / Compliance\nTechnical & Solution Design  \nThe proposed solution involves modifying existing folders to incorporate additional attributes and relationships, as well as updating the logic within the M2M Self Service Portal for creating necessary internal reports. This aligns with the architectural roadmap by ensuring compatibility with current systems and minimizing disruption. The implementation will utilize existing technologies and frameworks, focusing on improving performance while maintaining data integrity. The mapping in the source system is clear and accessible, ensuring a smooth integration process.\nCompliance evaluation\nDone.\n  3. NFR (if any)\nNon functional requirements\nNo.\n  4. SLA(if any)\nService Level Agreements\nN/A",
