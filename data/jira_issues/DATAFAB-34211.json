  "description": "Description\nPE and Initiative missing at the moment - temporarily the BE is directly linked to this epic\nWith this epic we create together with other teams / IT systems involved in this topic (MagF, SMART BI, ..) a solution concept for the demand \"One Forecasting (Day2)\" so that ..\n.. the functional scope has been defined in more detail and the scope share for all partners was clarified\n.. the technical feasibility was checked;  optional: if possible mockups or small PoC for critical parts were created and presented to the stakeholders\n.. the requirements regarding authorization were clarified\n.. a rough timeline for further development and the go live was agreed on; dependencies were identified.\n.. potential risks were identified and - if possible - measures for mitigation were defined.\nThe scope of this epic is mainly restricted to the OGK share of the solution, but of course we will work hand in hand with the other partners so that the solution concept makes sense as a whole.\nAs an output besides the documentation of the solution approach we also create at least one follow up epic for OGK / Team Insight if no showstopper was identified.\n\nBusiness Scope:\n&nbsp;",
