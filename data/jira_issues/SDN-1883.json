  "status": "Closed",
  "description": "Description\nSD LAN WIFI needs to get processable via Prima+ and PCM. The Product Catalog Administrator can then run the SD LAN request from the PCM interface and extract the latest data from Prima+. To prepare for the onboarding of the product, PCM needs to be fed the respective root PO/PS IDs and the selection logic needs to be implemented in the PCM subscriber service. CPQ needs to ensure that the Custom Tables structure matches the one used for the previous PCM implementations and allows for dynamic updating of these tables. This preparation includes the update of SD LAN specific scripts in the CPQ system.\n\nBusiness Scope:\nOnboarding SD LAN WIFI ensures the investment in the generic usability of PCM as integrator between Prima+ and PANDA CPQ and releaves thereby from handling efforts and errors caused by mediabreaks.",
