  "title": "Product MIST WAN R1.0: Exploration Customer Portal target solution customer onboarding & secure form",
  "status": "Funnel",
  "description": "Description\nCurrently, no integration with the SDX-Platform exists. The target process needs to reduce the manual efforts within MBN Portal, MyWorkplace & ICU as much as possible, when onboarding customers to the customer portal. Furthermore, solution options for sharing passwords between the customer and the SDX-Operations Team shall be explored. \n \n\nBusiness Scope:\nThe MIST WAN R. 1.0 shall be ready and live on the 30.06.2024. Scope of this Initiative is to explore the target solution for onboarding for MIST customers (UC1), as well explore a solution to share passwords with netcracker (UC8).\n\nThe customer onboarding based on the manual onboarding process vis-a-vis CSO is described in SDN-121. Condition from ICU to start with the interim solution for customer onboarding is that the target solution has been explored until 30.06.2024, as limitations exist to the # of customers that can be onboarded due to high manual efforts in customer portal and ICU.",
