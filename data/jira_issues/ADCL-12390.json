  "description": "Description\nProcess information:\nRequirements:\nBusiness transaction cancellation by Flamingo_\"Flamingo-induced total order cancellation in O3\":\nFlamingo offers that have been\ncanceled (\"storniert/verworfen\"),\nreturned and rejected (\"Fehler\") or\nfailed (\"Fehler\") and older than 30 calendar days (verified by Ashatar, 09.12.24)\nlead to a cancellation request in oPOM. \nIs the cancellation request accepted by oPOM, then this will lead to \nto a cancellation of the dependent total orders and\ntheir associated partial orders in O3/oPOM as well as the \ncancellation of all associated Camunda processes\nall partial order cancellation flows will be synchronized\nOption 2 for cancellation via Camunda will be implemented\nThis only applies to total orders\nwhose partial orders are in a status (cancelled, rejected, failed, held, aknowledged, to be verified) that qualifies the partial order to be cancelled and which have not passed to a point of time that doesn't qualify for a cancellation, e.g.\nhave not yet been submitted to EOS for further processing (point of no return, to be verified with EOS)\nThis functionality will be used independent of products\nSuccessful order cancellations should be fed back into Flamingo and POT (to be discussed)\nFTTH cancellation functionality and the TMF 622 standard order cancellation API will be used as blueprints\nCancellation can be built and tested without a respective Flamingo implementation. Flamingo can be mocked for development and testing purposes\nIt must also be possible to run it as a batch job in oPOM\nLink for Documentation in Wiki:\nhttps://wiki.telekom.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2361048623\nTarget process (in progress):\n  Useful Links:\n...\nResources:\nFlamingo:\nSimon Keck (PM)\nAshtar Siegle (PO)\nKay Maaß (PO)\nSimon Köppel (BA/Fachexperten)\nMartin Wendler (Fachseite & Auftragsübertragung)\nThorsten Gansen (Testing)\nMareen Jarick (Testing)\nKarim Azzaoui (Architekt/BA)\nStefan Fischer (Architekt)\nMBSP@FTTH:\nPO 360 Degrees/Portal: Matthias Lehmann\nBA 360 Degrees/Portal: Frank Gehlhaar\nBEO: Thorsten Hillemacher\nPO Team Comet (Cart/Checkout/POT): Andrea Öder\nBA Team Comet (Cart/Checkout/POT): Peter Max Messelken\nBA Team Comet (Cart/Checkout/POT): Stefan Wilkes\nPO GSP/Offer Preparation: Holger Peters\nBA GSP/Offer Preparation: Anil Kilickaplan\nFiber Deployment/GGS:\nTeam Dumbledore for Giga interfaces, incl. milestones, etc.:\nAndre Meyer (PO)\nArmela Memeti (BA)\nTeam Moon for FTTH/fiber availability checks:\nJürgen Kirch (PO)\nMagenta Force:\nBoban Bekic (PO)\nJürgen Brunner (BA)\nMatthias Johannes Hoffmann (BA/Architect)",
