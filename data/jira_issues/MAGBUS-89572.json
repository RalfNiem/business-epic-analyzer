  "title": "[NGMobile][UPSELL] Development & Delivery of Upsell Recommendation Solution",
  "status": "Waiting",
  "description": "Description\nDescription: Create a strategic approach for presenting upsell opportunities to customers, focusing on AGB products like Business Mobil/Data. The solution will involve selecting and highlighting a specific tariff chosen by the business for upsell visualization in the Single Page Application (SPA). With four slots available in the upsell section, the system must determine upsell possibilities, potentially involving Nepal for context-specific insights and roleType parameters. The upsell logic will prioritize selling higher-tier products, considering customer preferences and avoiding redundant offers of currently booked tariffs.\nAcceptance Criteria:\nImplement a system to identify and highlight a specific upsell tariff selected by the business.\nEfficiently allocate four slots for upsell products in the SPA.\nDetermine upsell possibilities through context checks, potentially involving Nepal for verification.\nIntegrate roleType in requests to tailor upsell opportunities.\nDevelop upsell logic that avoids suggesting already booked high-tier tariffs like L or XL unless contextually relevant.{}{}{}\nPotentially Open:\nBusiness Recommendation configurable and identifiable by SPA?\nAligned on a proper upsell approach ? (can be improved later, but some reliable starting point should be there)\nperformance?\ncaching?\nonly upsell?\nrole type?",
