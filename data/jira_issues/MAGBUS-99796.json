The catalog must therefore know all the dependencies between the products. It must be easy to recognize when there are multiple “T-shirt” sizes available for a tariff. An update path must be stored for outdated products so that, in the best case scenario, a suitable offer from the latest generation is always offered. The compatibility of the accessories should be stored for mobile devices.\nUnlike todays solution like BSP or CARMEN\nour solution contains information about which products can be combined with each other. The purpose of this information is to encourage the customer to select a higher quality version of their original product selection or additional products.\n ",
