Its aim is to provide the status of fiber availability for different locations to the user who can then offer fiber to his/her customer for these locations. \nThe FIB tool will be integrated with the Integrated offer in PANDA, but also provide an interface definition and API to be integrated to other Offering Tools within Deutsche Telekom Geschäftskunden (such as FLAMINGO ...). \nThe FIB Tool shell be used segment independent and therefore is usable by all segments (KMU, M, L, XL)\n  Contacts:\nStream Lead: Alexander Walter\nBusiness: Bernd Frauenknecht, Enrico Dettmann (SGRK/SBU), SSE?\nPOM (Technic): Biral Arduc\nPreorder@Cloud: Uwe Schoon (AM), Stefan Kitschke\n  Guardrails for FIB Tool targets: \nFIB is a project management / rollout management tool with a focus on address and location mgmt for larger customers/many locations\nFIB integrates into the existing application landscape and does not replace it (shell be possible to integrate from many systems, FLAMINGO, customer portal, Salesforce etc.)\n  This epic is a design epic, including:\nGenerate UX Design for location management (Import, Export, KLS, Projektkenner) \nGenerate UX Design and process workflow within FIB, including:\nlocation management\nrequest fiber availability status\nEntry in technik database of interested parties\nQuality gate for state \"VVMongoing\" (workflow to notify user)\nAbfrage und ggf.
