  "description": "Description\nThe VRRP routing platforms share the IP address corresponding to the default route configured on the hosts. At any time, one of the VRRP routing platforms is the primary (active) and the others are backups. If the primary routing platform fails, one of the backup routing platforms becomes the new primary routing platform, providing a virtual default routing platform and enabling traffic on the LAN to be routed without relying on a single routing platform. Using VRRP, a backup device can take over a failed default device within a few seconds. This is done with minimum VRRP traffic and without any interaction with the hosts.\n\nBusiness Scope:\nThe VRRP routing platforms share the IP address corresponding to the default route configured on the hosts.
