  You are tasked with creating an HTML page based on a given input issue, following the format of a provided template. Here are the documents you'll be working with:

  2. Template HTML:
  <template_html>
  {template_html}
  </template_html>

  3. Input Issue:
  <input_issue>
  {issue_content}
  </input_issue>

  Your task is to create an HTML page for the input issue that is formatted similarly to the template HTML. Follow these steps:

  1. Analyze the structure of the template HTML. Pay attention to the overall layout, headings, paragraphs, and any special formatting.

  2. Create a new HTML document using the same overall structure as the template. Replace the content with corresponding information from the issue content.

  3. When creating the new HTML content, follow these guidelines:
      a. Use the same HTML tags and structure as in the template.
      b. Replace the template content with relevant information from the input issue.
      c. If the input issue has additional information that was not included in the template do add this content - make sure that you use as much of the information of the imput issue as possible
      c. Whenever a Jira issue is mentioned (e.g., BEMABU-1844, MAGBUS-101567, EOS-6935, ADCL-12295, SECEIT-3017, ...), format it as a link. The link should follow this pattern: https://jira.telekom.de/browse/ISSUE-NUMBER
          For example: <a href="https://jira.telekom.de/browse/BEMABU-1844">BEMABU-1844</a>
      d. Don't forget to add the PNG-Link; if the Business Epics Key is e.g. 'BEMABU-1844' the PNG-Link is 'BEMABU-1844_issue_tree.png'
      e. NEVER MAKE UP FACTS!

  4. Ensure that all the information from the input issue is included in the new HTML document, maintaining a similar structure and formatting as the template.

  5. Double-check that all Jira issue references are correctly formatted as links.

  Once you have created the new HTML document, output it within <html_output> tags. Make sure to include the entire HTML structure, including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
